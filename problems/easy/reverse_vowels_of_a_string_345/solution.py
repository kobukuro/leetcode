# Tags: String, Two Pointers


class Solution:
    # Here, N is the length of the string s.
    # Time complexity: O(N)
    # It might be tempting to say that there are two nested loops and hence the complexity would be O(NÂ²).
    # However, if we observe closely the pointers start and end will only traverse the index once.
    # Each element of the string s will be iterated only once either by the left or right pointer and not both.
    # We swap characters when both pointers point to vowels which are O(1) operation.
    # Hence the total time complexity will be O(N).

    # Space complexity: O(N)
    # The space complexity analysis:
    # lst = list(s) creates a list copy of the input string, requiring O(N) space
    # The variables l, r use O(1) constant space
    # ''.join(lst) creates a new string from the list, requiring O(N) space
    # The is_vowel() function uses O(1) space
