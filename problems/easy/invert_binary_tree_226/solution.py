    # We cannot do better than that, since at the very least we have to visit each node to invert it.

    # Space complexity: O(n).
    # Because of recursion, O(h) function calls will be placed on the stack in the worst case,
    # where h is the height of the tree. Because hâˆˆO(n), the space complexity is O(n).
