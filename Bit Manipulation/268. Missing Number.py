# Time complexity : O(n)
# Because the set allows for O(1) containment queries, the main loop runs in O(n) time.
# Creating num_set costs O(n) time, as each set insertion runs in amortized O(1) time,
# so the overall runtime is O(n+n)=O(n).

# Space complexity : O(n)
# nums contains nâˆ’1 distinct elements,
# so it costs O(n) space to store a set containing all of them.
